# draft-ietf-is-csmp

Main body of the draft is written in markdown (the .md file).

The .md file is processed at https://author-tools.ietf.org/ to produce XML for IETF submission or other output formats.

Also in this repo ...
- the SVG diagrams are produced using websequencediagram.com.  Do note that proper IETF handling of SVG graphics remains a major problem.
- the .yaml for the OpenAPI definitions of the RESTful interfaces.
- the authoratative .proto file defining the message payload formats.

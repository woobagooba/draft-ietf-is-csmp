# draft-ietf-is-csmp

Main body of the draft is written in markdown (the .md file).

The .md file is processed at https://author-tools.ietf.org/ to produce XML for IETF submission or other output formats.

Also in this repo ...
- the SVG diagrams are produced using websequencediagram.com, which has an option that will output IETF's specific dialect of SVG.  IETF's insistence on a special dialect of SVG is an ongoing problem.   
- the .yaml for the OpenAPI definitions of the RESTful interfaces.  As can be seen in the .md file, IETF has required this be inlined into the draft.
- the authoratative .proto file defining the message payload formats.  Also required to be inlined into the draft.
